## HCL syntax extension for Panic Nova

Based off of [the TextMate Terraform](https://github.com/aurynn/Terraform.tmbundle) bundle (to some extent).

Implements a generic HCL grammar, and uses it to power the [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [Packer](https://packer.io)-specific grammars.

Eventually this will be moved to the offical Hashicorp language server.
