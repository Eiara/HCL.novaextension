## Unofficial HCL syntax extension for Panic Nova

Based off of [the TextMate Terraform](https://github.com/aurynn/Terraform.tmbundle) bundle (to some extent).

Implements a generic HCL grammar, and uses it to power the [Terraform](https://terraform.io) and [Packer](https://packer.io)-specific grammars.

Formatting for Terraform files is provided and enabled on save by default (this can be changed in the extension preferences).

Eventually this will be moved to the offical Hashicorp language server.

This extension is NOT maintained by Hashicorp.
